<!-- # React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh -->

Answering about how i managed the state -- 

• At first i am looking for the task and then find the task that i have to do.There were some tasks that 'display every json data' and 'Do sum of credit time and manage also remaining time'.So,for those work i have to display those data,and for this i have to do this task with state and it's prety easy.So for that,i manage a state with relavent variable and for some state,i have remained the existing value Zero and for some task i have remained the existing value is an Empty array.And by that,i have managed the state.
